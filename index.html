            And now, the end is near And so I face the final curtain <br /> My friend, I'll say it clear I'll state my case, of which I'm certain<br /> I've lived a life that's full I've traveled each and every highway<br /> And more, much more than this
            I did it my way.
        </p>
        <p>
            Regrets, I've had a few But then again, too few to mention<br /> I did what I had to do And saw it through without exemption<br /> I planned each charted course Each careful step along the byway<br /> And more, much more than this I did it
            my way
        </p>
        <p>
            Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew<br /> When I bit off more than I could chew<br /> But through it all, when there was doubt<br /> I ate it up and spit it out<br /> I faced it all and I stood tall<br /> And did it my way.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've loved, I've laughed and cried<br /> I've had my fill; my share of losing<br /> And now, as tears subside<br /> I find it all so amusing <br /> To think I did all that And may I say - not in a shy way<br /> "Oh no, oh no not me I did it
            my way"
        </p>
        <p>
            For what is a man, what has he got? <br /> If not himself, then he has naught To say the things he truly feels<br /> And not the words of one who kneels The record shows I took the blows<br /> And did it my way Yes, it was my way.
