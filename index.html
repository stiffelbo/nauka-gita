            And now, the end is near And so I face the final curtain
        </p>
        <p>
            My friend, I'll say it clear I'll state my case, of which I'm certain
        </p>
        <p>
            I've lived a life that's full I've traveled each and every highway
        </p>
        <p>
            And more, much more than this I did it my way.
        </p>
        <p>
            Regrets, I've had a few But then again, too few to mention
        </p>
        <p>
            I did what I had to do And saw it through without exemption
        </p>
        <p>
            I planned each charted course Each careful step along the byway
        </p>
        <p>
            And more, much more than this I did it my way
        </p>
        <p>
            Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew When I bit off more than I could chew
        </p>
        <p>
            But through it all, when there was doubt I ate it up and spit it out I faced it all and I stood tall And did it my way
        </p>
        <p>
            I've loved, I've laughed and cried I've had my fill; my share of losing And now, as tears subside
        </p>
        <p>
            I find it all so amusing To think I did all that And may I say - not in a shy way "Oh no, oh no not me I did it my way"
        </p>
        <p>
            For what is a man, what has he got? If not himself, then he has naught
        </p>
        <p>
            To say the things he truly feels And not the words of one who kneels
        </p>
        <p>
            The record shows I took the blows And did it my way Yes, it was my way.
